# Discovery Question Bank

> **Usage note:** This is a reference library, not a checklist. Pick 1-2 questions per phase that feel most relevant to the specific session. The Golden Questions are universal -- use at least 3 per session.

## Golden Questions

Five questions that consistently unlock the deepest insights across all discovery sessions. Use at least 3 per session.

### 1. "If this product never gets built, what happens?"
**Reveals:** True urgency vs. nice-to-have. If the answer is "nothing much" — the problem isn't painful enough.
**Red flag:** User can't articulate a concrete consequence.

### 2. "If you could only serve ONE user type, who survives?"
**Reveals:** Who the REAL primary user is. Forces prioritization over inclusion.
**Red flag:** "They're all equally important" — this means they haven't decided yet.

### 3. "Walk me through the worst version of this that would still be useful."
**Reveals:** The true MVP. Strips away ego and reveals core value.
**Red flag:** The "worst version" still has 12 features — scope isn't understood.

### 4. "What's the thing you're most afraid to say about this project?"
**Reveals:** Hidden risks, political dynamics, funding uncertainty, skill gaps.
**Red flag:** Deflection or "nothing, it's all good" — push gently.

### 5. "You said [X]. Why is that important?" (Ask 3 times in succession.)
**Reveals:** Root motivation via the 5 Whys technique. First answer is surface, third is truth.
**Red flag:** Circular reasoning — they return to the first answer.

## Phase 1: WHY — Problem Space

| Type | Question | Signal |
|------|----------|--------|
| Depth | *"How much does this problem cost people today — in time, money, or frustration?"* | Vague problems produce vague products. Forces quantification. |
| Depth | *"What's the current workaround? Walk me through it."* | The workaround IS your competition. |
| Challenge | *"Why hasn't a big company already done this?"* | Red flag: "they haven't thought of it" — unlikely. Dig deeper. |

## Phase 2: WHO — User Universe

| Type | Question | Signal |
|------|----------|--------|
| Depth | *"Describe [user type]'s Tuesday morning. What do they do before they'd ever open your product?"* | Builds empathy and reveals context of use. |
| Depth | *"Who pays [user type]? What are they measured on?"* | Reveals whether product aligns with user's incentives. |
| Challenge | *"Who benefits from the CURRENT broken system?"* | Red flag: dismisses the question — change resistance will be a surprise. |

## Phase 3: WHAT — Solution Space

| Type | Question | Signal |
|------|----------|--------|
| Depth | *"For [feature X]: what TRIGGERS the user to need this? What moment?"* | Features without triggers are features nobody uses. |
| Depth | *"What data does [feature X] need that you don't have yet?"* | Surfaces integration needs and cold-start problems. |
| Challenge | *"You listed [N] features. Which 3 stay if I delete the rest?"* | Red flag: can't choose — scope isn't prioritized. |

## Phase 4: REALITY — Constraints

| Type | Question | Signal |
|------|----------|--------|
| Depth | *"What's driving the deadline? Is it a real constraint or self-imposed?"* | Self-imposed deadlines can flex. Real ones can't. |
| Depth | *"What does 'done' look like? When do you pop champagne?"* | Misaligned definition of done is the #1 project killer. |
| Challenge | *"If the budget halved tomorrow, what changes?"* | Tests how robust the plan is under pressure. |

## Phase 5: UNCERTAINTY RADAR

| Type | Question | Signal |
|------|----------|--------|
| Depth | *"Would users pay [price X] for this? How do you know?"* | "I think so" vs "3 people told me yes" — very different. |
| Depth | *"What's the one technical thing that could make this impossible?"* | "Nothing" = hasn't thought deeply enough. |
| Challenge | List every assumption surfaced. *"Which of these is most dangerous if wrong?"* | Turns implicit risks into explicit, rankable decisions. |

## Industry-Specific Probes

| Industry | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| **SaaS** | *"What's the onboarding experience? How long until first value?"* / *"What happens when a user churns — do they lose data?"* |
| **Marketplace** | *"Which side do you acquire first — supply or demand?"* / *"What prevents supply and demand from cutting you out?"* |
| **E-Commerce** | *"What's the average order value? How many SKUs?"* / *"Where does inventory live? Who ships?"* |
| **Internal Tool** | *"Who's the executive sponsor? What's their success metric?"* / *"What system does this replace? How will data migrate?"* |
| **Client Project** | *"What does the client think they're getting vs. what they actually need?"* / *"Who has final approval? How many feedback rounds?"* |

## Participant-Adaptive Questions

| Persona | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Technical Founder** | Skip basic tech. Ask: *"Walk me through your architecture sketch. Where does it get hairy?"* / Challenge: *"Describe it from your user's perspective — no technical terms."* |
| **Non-Technical Client** | Focus on flows and feelings: *"When a customer opens this, what should they FEEL?"* / Translate: *"When you say 'fast,' what does fast mean — under 1 second? Same day?"* |
| **Product Manager** | Go deeper on metrics: *"What's your north star metric? What leading indicators predict it?"* / Challenge: *"You prioritized by business value. What about technical risk in P0?"* |
| **Designer** | Start visual: *"Show me any sketches, wireframes, or inspiration you have."* / Challenge: *"This looks beautiful. Now show me the error state, the empty state, and the loading state."* |
