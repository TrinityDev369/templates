# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions

## Project
<!-- Describe your project in 1-2 sentences -->

## Rules
1. Read before modifying — understand existing code before suggesting changes
2. Specs before code — write to `specs/` during planning, implement after approval
3. Avoid over-engineering — only make changes that are directly requested
4. Test what you build — run existing tests after modifications

## Quick Reference
- **Context**: `.claude/context/` — domain knowledge files
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` — specialized workflows
- **Agents**: `.claude/agents/` — role definitions for subagents

## Stack
<!-- List your tech stack: e.g., TypeScript, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL -->

## Coding Standards
<!-- Key conventions: naming, imports, error handling, testing -->

## When Stuck
1. Search the codebase for similar patterns
2. Check `.claude/skills/` for relevant workflow
3. Ask user with specific options (not open-ended)
