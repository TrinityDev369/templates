# Discovery Question Bank

Extended question library organized by phase. Each question includes **why it matters** and **red flags** to watch for in answers.

## Golden Questions

Five questions that consistently unlock the deepest insights across all discovery sessions. Use at least 3 per session.

### 1. "If this product never gets built, what happens?"
**Reveals:** True urgency vs. nice-to-have. If the answer is "nothing much" — the problem isn't painful enough.
**Red flag:** User can't articulate a concrete consequence.

### 2. "If you could only serve ONE user type, who survives?"
**Reveals:** Who the REAL primary user is. Forces prioritization over inclusion.
**Red flag:** "They're all equally important" — this means they haven't decided yet.

### 3. "Walk me through the worst version of this that would still be useful."
**Reveals:** The true MVP. Strips away ego and reveals core value.
**Red flag:** The "worst version" still has 12 features — scope isn't understood.

### 4. "What's the thing you're most afraid to say about this project?"
**Reveals:** Hidden risks, political dynamics, funding uncertainty, skill gaps.
**Red flag:** Deflection or "nothing, it's all good" — push gently.

### 5. "You said [X]. Why is that important?" (Ask 3 times in succession.)
**Reveals:** Root motivation via the 5 Whys technique. First answer is surface, third is truth.
**Red flag:** Circular reasoning — they return to the first answer.

## Phase 1: WHY — Problem Space

### Openers
- *"Something is broken or missing in the world. Tell me what it is — without telling me your solution."*
- *"Describe the last time someone was frustrated by the problem you're solving. What happened, step by step?"*

### Depth Probes
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| *"How much does this problem cost people today — in time, money, or frustration?"* | Forces quantification. Vague problems produce vague products. |
| *"What's the current workaround? Walk me through it."* | The workaround IS your competition. Understand it deeply. |
| *"Who tried to solve this before and failed? What went wrong?"* | Reveals hidden barriers — regulatory, technical, behavioral. |
| *"Is this problem getting worse or better on its own? Why?"* | Tests whether the market is growing or shrinking. |
| *"If you solve this, what NEW problem does that create?"* | Second-order thinking. Every solution creates new problems. |

### Challenge Probes
| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| *"Why hasn't a big company already done this?"* | Answer is "they haven't thought of it" — unlikely. Dig deeper. |
| *"Is this a vitamin or a painkiller?"* | User insists it's a painkiller but can't describe acute pain. |
| *"Would people pay to solve this today, with manual labor?"* | "No" — then willingness to pay for software is doubtful. |

## Phase 2: WHO — User Universe

### Openers
- *"Name every human who would ever touch, see, or be affected by this system."*
- *"Who has the problem? Who decides to buy? Who implements? Are these the same person?"*

### Depth Probes
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| *"Describe [user type]'s Tuesday morning. What do they do before they'd ever open your product?"* | Builds empathy and reveals context of use. |
| *"What does [user type] google when they have this problem?"* | Reveals language, search intent, and existing solutions. |
| *"How tech-savvy is [user type]? What tools do they already use daily?"* | Calibrates UX complexity expectations. |
| *"What would [user type] tell their friend about your product in one sentence?"* | Tests whether the value prop is clear enough to spread. |
| *"Who pays [user type]? What are they measured on?"* | Reveals whether product aligns with user's incentives. |

### Challenge Probes
| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| *"What would make [user type] STOP using this after the first week?"* | Can't answer — hasn't thought about retention. |
| *"Who benefits from the CURRENT broken system?"* | Dismisses the question — change resistance will be a surprise. |
| *"You said [user A] and [user B]. Do they ever conflict? Whose needs win?"* | "They never conflict" — they haven't thought about edge cases. |

### Persona Stress-Tests
- *"Imagine [user type] is having the worst day of their year. How does your product show up for them?"*
- *"What if [user type] uses your product wrong? What's the most dangerous misuse?"*
- *"[User type] has a competitor product open in the next tab. Why do they stay on yours?"*

## Phase 3: WHAT — Solution Space

### Openers
- *"Paint me a picture: a user opens your product for the first time. What do they see? What do they do?"*
- *"Show me — if you could sketch the main screen on a napkin, what's on it?"*

### Depth Probes
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| *"For [feature X]: what TRIGGERS the user to need this? What moment?"* | Features without triggers are features nobody uses. |
| *"What happens when [feature X] fails? Error message? Retry? Support ticket?"* | Error paths reveal product maturity thinking. |
| *"How does a user know [feature X] worked? What's the feedback/confirmation?"* | Invisible success = user uncertainty. |
| *"Is [feature X] used once, daily, or in a crisis? How often and when?"* | Usage frequency determines UI priority and architecture. |
| *"What data does [feature X] need that you don't have yet?"* | Surfaces integration needs and cold-start problems. |

### Challenge Probes
| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| *"You listed [N] features. Which 3 stay if I delete the rest?"* | Can't choose — scope isn't prioritized. |
| *"If [feature X] launched broken, who calls you to complain?"* | "Nobody" — it's not actually a P0. |
| *"Describe this product to someone who's never seen a computer. What does it DO?"* | Can't explain simply — the concept isn't clear enough. |
| *"Are these one product or three?"* | Gets defensive — separation of concerns needs discussion. |

### MVP Calibration
- *"If you had to launch in 2 weeks with a team of 2, what ships?"*
- *"What's the smallest thing you could build that would get ONE user to switch from their current workaround?"*
- *"Would you rather have 100 users who love 3 features, or 10 users who like 15 features?"*

## Phase 4: REALITY — Constraints

### Key Questions
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| *"What's driving the deadline? Is it a real constraint or self-imposed?"* | Self-imposed deadlines can flex. Real deadlines (events, contracts) can't. |
| *"What's the REAL budget — not the ideal, the actual number?"* | Plans built on fantasy budgets collapse. |
| *"If the budget halved tomorrow, what changes?"* | Tests how robust the plan is under pressure. |
| *"What technology is already in the building? What can't change?"* | Locked tech decisions constrain architecture dramatically. |
| *"Who makes the final decision on this project? Are they in this conversation?"* | If the decision maker isn't here, everything could change later. |
| *"What does 'done' look like? When do you pop champagne?"* | Misaligned definition of done is the #1 project killer. |

### Competitive Intelligence
- *"Who are the top 3 alternatives? What do they charge?"*
- *"What's the one thing competitors get RIGHT that you must match or beat?"*
- *"What do their 1-star reviews say? That's your opportunity."*
- *"Are you competing on price, experience, features, or something else?"*

## Phase 5: UNCERTAINTY RADAR

### Systematic Scan
| Risk Type | Question | Severity Signal |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Market** | *"How many people have you talked to about this? What did they say?"* | "I haven't talked to anyone yet" = high risk |
| **Market** | *"Would users pay [price X] for this? How do you know?"* | "I think so" vs "3 people told me yes" |
| **Technical** | *"What's the one technical thing that could make this impossible?"* | "Nothing" = hasn't thought deeply enough |
| **Technical** | *"Have you built a prototype? What did you learn?"* | No prototype + high complexity = high risk |
| **Design** | *"What's the UX moment where users will either get it or leave?"* | Can't identify = hasn't mapped the critical path |
| **Team** | *"Does anyone on the team have experience building something like this?"* | No = higher estimation error, plan for learning |
| **Dependencies** | *"What external thing must go right for this to work?"* | Many dependencies = fragile plan |

### Assumption Audit Template
At this point, list every assumption surfaced during the session:
```
Assumptions we're making:
1. [Users will pay for X] — Evidence: [none/anecdotal/validated]
2. [API Y supports feature Z] — Evidence: [docs say yes/untested]
3. [Market is large enough] — Evidence: [gut feel/research]
...

"Which of these is most dangerous if it turns out to be wrong?"
```

## Participant-Adaptive Questions

### For Technical Founders
- Skip basic tech questions. Instead: *"Walk me through your architecture sketch. Where does it get hairy?"*
- Challenge: *"You've described the system. Now describe it from your user's perspective — no technical terms."*

### For Non-Technical Clients
- Skip architecture. Focus on flows and feelings: *"When a customer opens this, what should they FEEL?"*
- Translate: *"When you say 'it should be fast,' what does fast mean to you? Under 1 second? Same day?"*

### For Product Managers
- Go deeper on metrics: *"What's your north star metric? What leading indicators predict it?"*
- Challenge: *"You've prioritized by business value. What about technical risk? Does anything hard land in P0?"*

### For Designers
- Start visual: *"Show me any sketches, wireframes, or inspiration screenshots you have."*
- Challenge: *"This looks beautiful. Now show me the error state, the empty state, and the loading state."*
