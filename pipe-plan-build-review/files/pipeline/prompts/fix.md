{{REVIEW_CONTENT}}

## Your Task
Fix every Critical and Major issue listed in the review above. For each fix:
1. Read the relevant file
2. Apply the minimal fix that resolves the issue
3. Commit the fix with a message referencing the issue

## Rules
- Fix Critical issues first, then Major
- Minor issues are optional — fix only if trivial
- Don't refactor beyond what's needed for the fix
- Commit each fix separately for clear history
- Run `tsc --noEmit` after TypeScript changes
