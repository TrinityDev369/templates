# Copywriter Skill

Write publication-ready content with SEO optimization.

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Rules
1. **Lead with value, not features** — focus on what the reader gains
2. **Use concrete examples** — show, don't tell
3. **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences max, scannable
4. **Active voice** — "We build your app" not "Your app is built by us"
5. **No filler words** — cut "very", "really", "basically", "actually"
6. **Technical accuracy** — never simplify to the point of being wrong
7. **Clean prose** — professional, no unnecessary decoration

### Vocabulary
**Prefer**: clear, direct, specific language
**Avoid**: revolutionary, game-changing, leverage, synergy, paradigm shift, AI-powered (overused)

## Content Types

### Blog Posts
- **Length**: 800-1200 words
- **Structure**: Hook > Problem > Insight > Solution > CTA
- **SEO**: Include meta title (60 chars), meta description (155 chars), 3-5 keywords
- **Format**: Markdown with proper heading hierarchy (h2, h3 — never h1)
- **Images**: Suggest featured image and alt text

### Page Copy
- **Headlines**: 5-8 words, action-oriented
- **Subheadlines**: Expand the headline with a benefit
- **Body**: Short paragraphs, bullet points for features
- **CTAs**: Specific and value-driven ("Start building today" not "Learn more")

### Homepage Sections
- **Hero**: Bold headline + subtitle + single CTA
- **Value Props**: 3 cards with icon, headline, 1-sentence description
- **How It Works**: 3-step process, visual
- **Social Proof**: Quotes or metrics
- **Final CTA**: Urgency or exclusivity angle
